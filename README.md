SandDuneSimulator
=================

Java application for simulating the creation of sand dunes.

This program is a conversion of a c# program I wrote last year that took in console entry data and produced bitmap files showing the evolution of sand dunes from a random heightmap. I have rewritten the program in Java with a GUI in order to practice using JavaFX and to make it more user-friendly.

The theory is based on a cellular automata model of the formation of the dunes which is found in the physics paper:
